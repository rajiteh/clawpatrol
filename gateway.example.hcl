# SSH endpoints. The wire protocol carries no SNI / Host header, so
# the gateway runs a DNS server inside the WG tunnel and answers
# A/AAAA queries for SSH-able hostnames with virtual IPs from
# 10.78.0.0/16 and fd78::/64. When the client connects to the VIP
# the gateway recovers the hostname, terminates SSH on both halves,
# and uses the credential below for upstream auth.
#
# VIPs are persisted under <state_dir>/dnsvip.json so they survive
# restarts AND policy reloads — clients' cached DNS answers stay
# valid through gateway hops. Each SSH endpoint also gets its own
# persisted host key under <ca_dir>/ssh/<endpoint>.key on first use;
# add the printed fingerprint to the user's known_hosts file (the
# dashboard surfaces it per endpoint).

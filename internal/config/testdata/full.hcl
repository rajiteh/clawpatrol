# Example policy (v15).
#
# v15 inverts the v14 dependency direction. Today's shape:
#
#     endpoint → (nothing)
#     credential → endpoint
#     rule → endpoint  (+ optional credential predicate)
#     approver → credential
#     profile → credential
#
# An endpoint is a pure network target — hosts + protocol-family
# connection params, no credential refs, no dispatch table. The
# credential, not the endpoint, owns the binding between "secret
# material" and "where it gets injected." Profiles enumerate the
# secrets a user is allowed to wield; endpoint membership rides along
# transitively (profile → credentials → endpoints).

#   2. Apply policy rules: allow, deny with a reason, or route through

# Per-kind namespace. Names must be unique within a kind; the same
# string may name one endpoint and one credential (different kinds)
# without collision, because every reference syntactically carries the
# kind via its type label.
#
# References are typed traversals — `<type>.<name>` for two-label
# kinds, `<kind>.<name>` for one-label kinds:
#
#     endpoint    = https.anthropic-ops
#     credentials = [bearer_token.github-ops]
#     approve     = [llm_approver.fast]
#
# The leading label is required: the loader resolves `https.foo` as
# the endpoint of type `https` named `foo`. There is no bare-name
# resolution and no `credential.bearer_token...` triple-segment form.
#
# Note: ClickHouse exposes two protocols (HTTPS API + native binary)
# from the same upstream cluster, so two endpoints share the upstream:
# `ch-o11y-https` and `ch-o11y-native`. One credential (`ch-o11y`)
# binds both via

# ║ 4. CREDENTIAL → ENDPOINT BINDING                                 ║
# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# Each credential declares which endpoint(s) it authenticates against.
# Two binding shapes:
#
#   (a) Singular:
#
#         credential "bearer_token" "grafana" {
#           endpoint = https.grafana
#         }
#
#       The credential authenticates exactly one endpoint. This is the
#       common case.
#
#   (b) Singleton-or-list, for one credential reused at multiple
#       protocol endpoints of the same upstream:
#
#         credential "clickhouse_credential" "ch-o11y" {
#           endpoints = [clickhouse_https.ch-o11y-https, clickhouse_native.ch-o11y-native]
#           user      = "ops"
#         }
#
#       The same secret authenticates at all listed endpoints. Used
#       when one upstream exposes the same auth material over multiple
#       protocol surfaces (clickhouse_https + clickhouse_native).
#
# Multi-credential dispatch (placeholder, on the profile). When a
# profile actively wields more than one credential at the same
# endpoint, the credentials list mixes direct traversal entries with
# inline `{ placeholder = "PH_...", credential = <type>.<name> }`
# objects that name the dispatch discriminator the agent sends for each:
#
#     profile "ops" {
#       credentials = [
#         { placeholder = "PH_orb_test", credential = bearer_token.orb-test },
#         { placeholder = "PH_orb_prod", credential = bearer_token.orb-prod },
#         ...
#       ]
#     }
#
# At inject time the gateway scans the request for one of the
# placeholders and substitutes the matching credential's real secret.
# A direct credential traversal in the same profile is the
# no-placeholder fallback — at most one per (profile, endpoint), used
# when no agent placeholder matches. The exact "no-placeholder" semantic is
# plugin-defined: HTTPS overwrites Authorization regardless of what
# the agent sent; postgres swaps the agent's password for the real
# one.
#
# Why placeholders live on the profile, not on the credential:
#
#   - A placeholder is only needed when a profile uses more than one
#     credential at the same endpoint. Per-user-fanout endpoints
#     (github, slack, telegram, openai-codex) globally have multiple
#     credentials, but each profile typically wields just one — so
#     declaring placeholders on the credential side adds noise that no
#     profile actually consults. Profile-scoped placeholders only
#     appear where ambiguity actually exists.
#   - Credentials become pure secret handles + endpoint binding,
#     symmetrical with the way endpoints are pure network targets.
#   - Adding the same credential to a second profile that needs a
#     different discriminator (rare, but legal) is one map entry, not
#     a schema fight.

# ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
#
# Each rule is a top-level resource (PagerDuty / AWS LB style). It
# declares:
#
#   - which endpoint(s) it applies to (`endpoint = X` or
#     `endpoints = [X, Y, ...]`),
#   - an optional `credential = <type>.<name>` reference (request
#     must have been dispatched against that credential),
#   - an optional CEL `condition = "..."` predicate,
#   - one outcome: `verdict = "allow"`, `verdict = "deny"` (with
#     `reason`), or an `approve = [...]` chain.
#
# Why top-level rules, not nested under endpoints:
#
#   - Cross-endpoint rules (k8s-no-secrets across three clusters,
#     pg-banned-verbs across both postgres servers) can name the
#     full endpoint list directly: `endpoints = [a, b, c]`. No
#     duplication; no inheritance machinery.
#   - Each rule has one obvious place. `grep '"k8s-no-secrets"'`
#     finds it.
#   - The data shape matches what the gateway stores (a flat
#     `approval_rules` table scoped per integration), so no clever
#     compilation step is required at load.
#
# Family inference. `rule "<name>"` — one block kind, no type
# label. The rule's protocol family is inferred from its endpoint(s)
# at load time and pins the CEL variables available to the condition
# (a rule targeting a postgres endpoint sees the `sql` variable, not
# `http`). A rule's referenced endpoints must all be of the same
# protocol family, or it's a load error.
#
#   https endpoints  → `http` variable
#   postgres,
#   clickhouse_https,
#   clickhouse_native → `sql` variable
#   kubernetes       → `k8s` variable
#
# Evaluation. For each request, the runtime collects all rules that
# (1) name the request's endpoint and (2) are not `disabled = true`.
# It sorts by `priority` descending and walks the list; the first
# rule whose `credential` (if set) matches and whose CEL `condition`
# evaluates true decides the outcome. First-match-wins. An absent
# or empty `condition` matches every request.
#
# Priority is a single signed integer:
#
#   priority > 0     "override" — wins over default-priority rules
#   priority = 0     default (the field is omitted)
#   priority < 0     "fallback" — runs after every >= 0 rule
#
# When to set priority:
#
#   - Don't, by default. If two rules have mutually-exclusive matches
#     (different methods, different paths, different credentials),
#     evaluation order doesn't matter — leave them at priority 0.
#
#   - Use a positive priority when a narrower rule needs to win over
#     a broader rule with a different outcome. Example:
#     `stripe-extra-scrutiny` (priority 100) routes a curated list of
#     destructive paths to the stricter `billing-strict` approver,
#     overriding `stripe-other-writes` (priority 0) which would
#     otherwise send everything to the lenient `billing` approver.
#
#   - Use a negative priority for catch-all / default-deny rules.
#     Example: `support-console-default` (priority -100) denies
#     everything not matched by an earlier explicit rule.
#
# v15 distribution: 11 rules with positive priority (overrides),
# 8 with negative priority (catch-alls), 35 at default 0.
#
# Disabled rules. `disabled = true` keeps a rule in source for audit
# / rollback without removing it. Lowers to `enabled = 0`.
#
# Per-family CEL variables. Each family exposes one struct-typed
# top-level variable; fields are accessed with dot notation.
#
#   https → http.method, http.path, http.query, http.headers,
#           http.body, http.body_json
#   sql   → sql.verb, sql.tables, sql.functions, sql.statement
#   k8s   → k8s.verb, k8s.resource, k8s.namespace, k8s.name,
#           k8s.params
#
# `verb` (sql, k8s) and `method` (http) are unary strings. `tables`
# and `functions` (sql) are list[string]; `query` and `headers`
# (http) are map[string]list[string]; `params` (k8s) is
# map[string]string. `body` is the raw request body as string;
# `body_json` is its parsed-JSON shape (dyn).
#
# CEL idioms used throughout this file:
#
#   - Membership / exact-or-any-of: `sql.verb in ['select', 'show']`,
#     `http.method == 'POST'`.
#   - Prefix / suffix / substring: `k8s.name.startsWith('debug-')`,
#     `k8s.resource.endsWith('/exec')`,
#     `http.body.contains('approve_')`.
#   - Regex (for what globs and startsWith can't express):
#     `sql.statement.matches('(?i)\\bsecret\\b')`.
#   - List intersection (sql `tables` / `functions` against a
#     deny-list):
#     `sets.intersects(sql.functions, ['pg_read_file', ...])`.
#     The `sets` extension is registered on every facet env.

# A profile is a credential membership list:
#
#     profile "alice" { credentials = [bearer_token.github-alice, slack_tokens.slack-alice, ...] }
#
# Three observations:
#
#   - Profiles do NOT reference endpoints directly. Endpoint membership
#     is the transitive closure profile → credentials → endpoints.
#     Rules are tied to endpoints, so including a credential in a
#     profile transitively includes every endpoint that credential
#     binds and every rule attached to it.
#
#   - Sharing is by reference. notion-corp / grafana / ch-o11y /
#     k8s-dev-{iad,sfo}-mtls all appear in multiple profiles; they map
#     to one credential row each, with M:N joins to the listed profiles.
#
#   - Multi-credential endpoints (anthropic-ops, orb, pg-corp) list
#     BOTH credentials in the profile that wields them, wrapped in
#     `{ placeholder = "PH_...", credential = name }` entries that
#     disambiguate the wire-time dispatch. Per-user-fanout endpoints
#     (github, slack, telegram, openai-codex) are also globally
#     multi-credential, but each profile typically wields just one
#     credential per endpoint and needs no placeholders. The one
#     exception is bob's openai-codex — bob wields both his and
#     carol's credentials, so his profile carries inline placeholders
#     on both entries.
#
# v15 has three profiles:
#
#   ops    — full ops coverage (anthropic dual-cred, stripe, orb dual,

#            Honeycomb, PagerDuty, customer support helpdesk).

# stripe idempotency-key behaviour, header name overrides, ...). They
# never hold the secret value itself.
#
# Multi-credential endpoints (anthropic-ops, orb, pg-corp) appear as
# N credentials each pointing at the shared endpoint. The dispatch
# discriminator lives on the profile that wields them — see the
# inline `{ placeholder = "PH_...", credential = ... }` entries in

# singleton-or-list `endpoints` form (one credential, two endpoints).

# ── Rules ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Each section below covers one upstream service or service family.
# The pattern is consistent:
#
#   1. Allow reads (GET / SELECT) outright.
#   2. Allow specific safe write paths (annotations, snapshots,
#      ephemeral keys, search) outright.
#   3. Override-priority rules for the most dangerous mutations
#      (extra-scrutiny billing endpoints, k8s secret reads, k8s
#      port-forward outside debug-* pods).
#   4. Default-priority rules for normal writes → human approval.
#   5. Negative-priority catch-all denies anything that fell through.

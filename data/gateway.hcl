#
# Pure network targets: hosts + protocol-family connection params.
# No credential refs — credential binding lives on the credential
# blocks below. The endpoint family (https / ssh / postgres /

# gateway speaks and which CEL variable rules see (`http`, `sql`,
# `k8s`).

# HTTPS — AI providers.

# SSH — the wire protocol carries no SNI / Host header, so the
# gateway runs a DNS server inside the WG tunnel and answers A/AAAA
# queries for SSH-able hostnames with virtual IPs from 10.78.0.0/16
# and fd78::/64. When the client connects to the VIP the gateway
# recovers the hostname, terminates SSH on both halves, and uses
# the credential below for upstream auth.
#
# VIPs are persisted in sqlite so they survive restarts AND policy
# reloads — clients' cached DNS answers stay valid through gateway
# hops. Each SSH endpoint also gets its own persisted host key (in
# sqlite); the dashboard surfaces the fingerprint to paste into
# known_hosts.

#
# One endpoint, two credentials: readonly and writer share the same
# upstream server. The postgres user is the dispatch discriminator —
# the gateway picks the credential whose `user` matches the agent's
# StartupMessage user. Rules below use `credential = pg-writer`
# to gate writes; reads run through `pg-readonly` and bypass
# the write-only rules.

# The actual secret value is stored separately keyed by name (paste

# AI providers — three common shapes.

#     Use this when you also need to call the API from your own
#     rules (the llm_approver below).

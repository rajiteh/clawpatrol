# Configure the gateway

[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) gets you running with
the example config, untouched. This page covers the operational
tuning you reach for as soon as you take the gateway past
"kick-the-tyres" — different control plane, dashboard auth,
where to bind the dashboard, systemd, state-dir hardening, and
the rest.

## Control plane: WireGuard or Tailscale

The example config uses WireGuard:

```hcl
control        = "wireguard"
wg_subnet_cidr = "10.55.0.0/24"
```

If your fleet already lives on a tailnet, swap to embedded tsnet:

```hcl
control = "tailscale"
funnel  = true
listen  = ":8443"

oauth_client_id     = "<tailscale oauth client id>"
oauth_client_secret = "<tailscale oauth client secret>"
tailscale_tags      = ["tag:clawpatrol"]
```

Embedded tsnet joins the tailnet in-process — no UDP port to open,
no `iptables` rule, no host Tailscale daemon. `funnel = true` lets
non-tailnet devices reach the gateway over Tailscale Funnel.
Devices onboard with `clawpatrol login` instead of `clawpatrol
join`; see [CLI reference](/docs/cli/) for the Tailscale variant.

### WireGuard endpoint

The default WireGuard listener is `0.0.0.0:51820`. Clients dial
`host(public_url):port`, so you only set `wg_endpoint` when you
need a non-default port or a different host for WG than for the
dashboard:

```hcl
wg_endpoint = ":41820"                # custom port, default host
wg_endpoint = "wg.example.com:51820"  # split-host deployment
```

## Dashboard auth

**The dashboard is how operators connect endpoint credentials
and inspect live traffic, so it requires a password on every
request.**

The first time you open the dashboard you set a `root` password.
It lives bcrypt-hashed in `clawpatrol.db` and is checked on every
subsequent request. You can also manage the password from the CLI:

```bash
clawpatrol gateway --set-dashboard-password '<password>' gateway.hcl
clawpatrol gateway --reset-dashboard-password gateway.hcl
```

### Where to bind the dashboard

Restricting where the dashboard is reachable on the network is
an additional defence-in-depth layer on top of the password.
Pick the shape that matches your access model:

- **Loopback (`127.0.0.1:8080`)** — the default in the example.
  Reach the dashboard via SSH tunnel
  (`ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080 gateway-host`) or a local reverse
  proxy.
- **Tailnet / VPN IP (`100.x.x.x:8080`)** — only devices already
  on your tailnet or WireGuard subnet can reach it. List each
  operator's Tailscale account email in `dashboard_operators` to
  let them in without typing the password:

  ```hcl
  dashboard_operators = [
    "alice@example.com",
    "bob@example.com",
  ]
  ```

  Tagged devices (agents) never match the allowlist.
- **Public (`0.0.0.0:8080`)** — works, but everyone on the
  internet sees a login page. Front it with an auth proxy
  (Cloudflare Access, oauth2-proxy) if you really need it.

## Run under systemd

For anything beyond a quick test, run the gateway as a dedicated
service user so its state directory isn't readable by any
non-root user on the box:

```bash
useradd --system --home /opt/clawpatrol --shell /usr/sbin/nologin clawpatrol
chown -R clawpatrol:clawpatrol /opt/clawpatrol
chmod 700 /opt/clawpatrol
```

Drop the following at
`/etc/systemd/system/clawpatrol-gateway.service`, adjusting the
three paths to wherever you put the binary and config:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=clawpatrol gateway
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=clawpatrol
Group=clawpatrol
WorkingDirectory=/opt/clawpatrol
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/clawpatrol gateway /opt/clawpatrol/gateway.hcl
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=2
LimitNOFILE=65536

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now clawpatrol-gateway
journalctl -u clawpatrol-gateway -f       # tail the gateway log
```

If you skip the dedicated-user step, the gateway logs a warning
at startup when `state_dir` or `clawpatrol.db` is readable beyond
owner.

## Security notes

A few footguns worth knowing about before you point an agent at a
production Claw Patrol gateway:

- **Don't run agents on the gateway host.** `clawpatrol run` is
  for client devices — the gateway's `state_dir` holds every
  credential the gateway mints plus the audit log. An agent running on
  the gateway host can read those directly, with or without
  `clawpatrol run` in front. The correct shape is: gateway on
  one box (small VPS, no human logins, no developer tools); your
  laptop / CI runner joins it over WireGuard. `clawpatrol run`
  prints a heads-up if it detects a gateway state db in a common
  location.

- **Lock down `state_dir`.** The systemd snippet above creates a
  dedicated `clawpatrol` service user with mode-700 ownership; if
  you skip that, anyone with shell access to the gateway host can
  read every credential. The gateway warns at startup when
  `state_dir` or `clawpatrol.db` is readable beyond owner.

- **`clawpatrol join --whole-machine` is for client devices
  only.** Running it on the gateway host itself routes the host's
  own traffic through its own WireGuard endpoint — a loop that
  breaks DNS, outbound traffic from the gateway daemon, and the
  dashboard's reachability. Per-process routing (the default
  `clawpatrol join` + `clawpatrol run` shape) is also what most
  people actually want on a multi-purpose laptop, so they don't
  accidentally route every browser tab through the gateway.

## Build from source

Released binaries are the supported path. To build from source
instead — for example to track an unreleased branch — set
`CLAWPATROL_FROM_SOURCE=1` on the installer (requires Go):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawpatrol.dev/install.sh | CLAWPATROL_FROM_SOURCE=1 sh
```

Set `CLAWPATROL_REF` to install a non-`main` ref.

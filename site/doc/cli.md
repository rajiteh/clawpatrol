# CLI Reference

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawpatrol.dev/install.sh | sh
```

The installer drops a single statically linked Go binary in
`~/.local/bin`. The `clawpatrol` command is the unified entry point for
both the proxy server and the client tools.

## Commands

### `clawpatrol onboard`

Interactive setup wizard. Starts a local proxy, scans for API
keys, and configures your system.

```bash
clawpatrol onboard [--server URL]
```

Options:
- `--server URL` — skip the gateway selector and connect to a
  specific server (e.g. `--server https://gateway.example.com`)

### `clawpatrol run`

Run a command with its traffic routed through the proxy.

```bash
clawpatrol run [--name NAME] [--profile PROFILE] [--no-expose] [--sub-user] [--fs-access PATH]... <command> [args...]
```

Options:
- `--name NAME` — session name (defaults to the command name)
- `--profile PROFILE` — use a specific integration profile
- `--no-expose` — don't tunnel the wrapped command's TCP
  listeners back to the host (Linux only; default is to
  auto-tunnel)
- `--sub-user` — run the wrapped command under a subordinate
  UID for filesystem isolation (Linux only; requires an
  `/etc/subuid` entry). By default the command runs as the
  calling user so it can read `~/.claude`, `~/.config`, git
  credentials, ssh keys, and other per-user state. Opt into
  `--sub-user` when you want the command sandboxed away from
  your home directory.
- `--fs-access PATH` — expose a host file or directory to the
  wrapped command at the same absolute path (Linux only).
  Repeatable. Only meaningful with `--sub-user`; otherwise the
  wrapped command already runs as you and has native access.

Examples:
```bash
clawpatrol run claude
clawpatrol run --name my-agent python agent.py
clawpatrol run --profile production gh pr create
```

The proxy injects API keys and logs all traffic for the
duration of the command. When the command exits, the session
ends.

If you omit the `run` subcommand, clawpatrol treats the arguments
as a wrapped command automatically:

```bash
clawpatrol claude            # equivalent to: clawpatrol run claude
```

### `clawpatrol gateway`

Start the proxy server directly (without the onboard wizard).

```bash
clawpatrol gateway
```

This starts the CONNECT proxy on port 8443 and the
dashboard/API on port 8080. Useful for running clawpatrol as a
persistent service or in Docker.

### `clawpatrol offboard`

Remove clawpatrol from this machine.

```bash
clawpatrol offboard [-y] [--delete-data] [--keep-data]
```

Options:
- `-y`, `--yes` — skip confirmation prompt
- `--delete-data` — remove all data in `~/.clawpatrol`
- `--keep-data` — keep data (don't ask)

### `clawpatrol join`

Register this device with an existing gateway. The URL is the only
positional argument; `--hostname`, `--profile`, `--whole-machine`,
and `--no-trust` are optional flags.

```bash
clawpatrol join <gateway-url>
```

### `clawpatrol --version`

Print the version and exit. Also accepts `-V`.

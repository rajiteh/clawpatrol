# CLI Reference

The `clawpatrol` binary is the unified entry point for both the
gateway server and the client tools. Same binary, different
subcommands.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://clawpatrol.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Statically-linked Go binary, dropped in `~/.local/bin`. macOS and
Linux on amd64 + arm64. Set `CLAWPATROL_FROM_SOURCE=1` to build from
source instead (requires Go + `gh auth login`).

## Commands

### `clawpatrol gateway init`

One-shot setup wizard for a new gateway host. Detects the public IP,
generates a CA, writes `gateway.hcl`, opens firewall ports, drops a
systemd unit when systemd is around, and prints the next-step
command.

```bash
clawpatrol gateway init [flags]
```

Flags (all optional, sensible defaults):

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--data-dir DIR` | `/etc/clawpatrol` (root) or `~/.clawpatrol` | Where `gateway.hcl`, CA, and state live |
| `--public-url URL` | auto-detected | Dashboard URL, used in onboarding QR codes |
| `--public-ip IP` | auto-detected | Public IP for the WG endpoint |
| `--wg-port N` | `51820` | WireGuard UDP port |
| `--dash-port N` | `9080` | Dashboard / onboard HTTP port |
| `--tls-port N` | `8443` | TLS gateway port (host-local; doesn't need to be public) |
| `--subnet CIDR` | `10.55.0.0/24` | WireGuard subnet pool for devices |
| `--no-firewall` | off | Skip iptables ACCEPT rules |

### `clawpatrol gateway`

Run the gateway daemon against an HCL config.

```bash
clawpatrol gateway <config.hcl> [--read-only-config]
```

`--read-only-config` rejects dashboard writes to the HCL file —
appropriate when the file is owned by a deploy pipeline. See
[config-reference](config-reference) for the HCL grammar.

### `clawpatrol join`

Enroll the current device with a gateway. Prints a one-time code,
opens the dashboard so an operator can confirm and assign a
profile, persists the WireGuard conf, and installs the CA in your
trust store. Falls back to the Tailscale path (see `login` below)
when the gateway runs in Tailscale mode.

```bash
clawpatrol join <gateway-url> [flags]
```

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--hostname NAME` | OS hostname | Device name registered with the gateway |
| `--profile NAME` | gateway default | Profile to assign at approval time |
| `--whole-machine` | off | Bring up `wg-quick` and route every packet through the gateway (default: persist conf only and use `clawpatrol run`) |
| `--no-trust` | off | Fetch the CA but skip system trust install |
| `--ca-dir DIR` | `~/.clawpatrol` | Where to store the fetched CA |
| `--name NAME` | `clawpatrol` | Exit-node hostname (only used when the gateway is on Tailscale) |

### `clawpatrol login`

Tailscale-based onboarding alternative for fleets already on a
tailnet. Joins the device to the tailnet, finds the gateway by its
exit-node hostname, and installs the CA.

```bash
clawpatrol login [flags]
```

| Flag | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `--name NAME` | `clawpatrol` | Exit-node hostname to look for on the tailnet |
| `--no-trust` | off | Fetch the CA but skip system trust install |
| `--no-exit-node` | off | Skip setting the tailscale exit-node (run manually) |

### `clawpatrol run`

Run a command with its traffic routed through the joined gateway.

```bash
clawpatrol run [--conf <path>] -- <command> [args...]
```

`--conf` points at the WG conf written by `clawpatrol join`; defaults
to the standard location so you rarely need it. On Linux the wrapped
command runs in an unprivileged user namespace with a private WG
tunnel; on macOS the Network Extension does the capture.

```bash
clawpatrol run -- claude
clawpatrol run -- gh pr create
clawpatrol run -- psql 'host=db user=agent'
```

The agent sees a normal network — outbound flows just route through
the gateway, which matches each request against the rules, injects
the configured credential, and forwards.

### `clawpatrol test`

Replay recorded gateway actions against a candidate HCL policy and
report verdict drift.

```bash
clawpatrol test <config.hcl> <fixture.json | fixture-dir>
```

See [`clawpatrol-test`](clawpatrol-test) for the fixture format and
CI integration. Exit 0 = all match, 1 = drift, 2 = usage/config
error.

### `clawpatrol validate`

Parse and compile a gateway HCL config, then exit. Use it in CI to
catch typos before they hit production.

```bash
clawpatrol validate <config.hcl>
```

### `clawpatrol status`

Report device install state — whether `join`/`login` ran, whether
the CA is trusted, whether the WG conf or tailnet membership is
healthy.

```bash
clawpatrol status
```

### `clawpatrol uninstall`

Tear down everything `join` / `login` put on this machine — stops
the macOS Network Extension, brings down the WG interface, removes
the CA from system trust, drops per-user state dirs, strips the
shell-rc.

```bash
clawpatrol uninstall [-y] [--keep-ca] [--keep-conf]
```

### `clawpatrol env`

Print the shell exports clawpatrol injects when wrapping a command
(`SSL_CERT_FILE`, credential-placeholder env vars). Source from
your shell rc if you need them outside `clawpatrol run`.

```bash
eval "$(clawpatrol env)"
```

### `clawpatrol version`

Print the version. Also accepts `-v` and `--version`.

## Environment variables

Most configuration lives in `gateway.hcl` on the gateway side. A few
device-side knobs:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CLAWPATROL_RUN_CONF` | Override the WG conf path `clawpatrol run` reads |
| `CLAWPATROL_NO_ENV` | Skip the env pushdown (`SSL_CERT_FILE`, placeholders) when wrapping a command |
| `CLAWPATROL_TELEMETRY` | `0` to disable telemetry (same as `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`) |
| `DO_NOT_TRACK` | Standard opt-out, honored |
| `TS_AUTHKEY` | Used by `clawpatrol login` to authenticate to Tailscale non-interactively |

## Data directories

Where state lives, by role:

**Gateway host** (set up by `gateway init`):

```
/etc/clawpatrol/                (root) — or ~/.clawpatrol (non-root)
  gateway.hcl                   HCL config (operator-edited)
  oauth/clawpatrol.db           SQLite — everything else
```

The sqlite DB holds the CA cert + key, WireGuard server key, SSH
host keys, sessions, audit log, telemetry UUID, and DNS-VIP
allocations. Path is configurable via the top-level `state_dir`
attribute (defaults to `oauth/` next to `gateway.hcl` for
historical layout compat).

**Device** (set up by `join` / `login`):

```
~/.clawpatrol/
  ca.crt                  Fetched gateway CA
~/.config/clawpatrol/
  wg.conf                 Per-device WireGuard config (join path)
```
